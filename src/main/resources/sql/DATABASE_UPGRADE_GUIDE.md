# LinShare upgrade guide

## LinShare Versions

LinShare version number are named according to the following pattern
X.Y.Z.

* X : Major release
A major version can bring disruptive changes, among which addition/replacement/removal of technologies used in the product.
They could break compatibility between two versions of LinShare.

* Y : Minor release
A minor version brings new functionalities and possibly database schema modification.

* Z : Maintenance release
Only bug fixes. No database schema modification.



##Â Migration scripts

Migration scripts are specific for each database management system.
You have one directory by supported database management system.
All scripts are named according to the following pattern
"Migration_X.A.0_to_X.B.0.sql".

In order to upgrade LinShare from 1.1 to 1.4 you ALWAYS need to run all scripts : 
	1. Migration_1.1.0_to_1.2.0.sql
	2. Migration_1.2.0_to_1.3.0.sql
	3. Migration_1.3.0_to_1.4.0.sql


## How To

### Stop LinShare

	* postgresql	: pg_dump

	* mysql		: mysqldump

### upgrade database

	* postgresql :

> psql -U linshare -d linshare

> \i ...

	* mysql	:

## Migration with particularity

### 1.4.0 to 1.5.0

* postgresql :
This migration script must be run with user postgres because we used plpgpsql language.

For postgresql 8+, you may need to comment "DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS plpgsql;" command from the migration script
because this version do not support it.

* mysql :
Nothing particular.
